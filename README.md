# Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate data science graduate with a strong foundation in AI engineering, machine learning, software development, and business intelligence. I am driven by a desire to leverage technology to solve complex problems and drive innovative solutions.
Recently, I developed a context-aware AI assistant for academic planning at Teesside University where I fine-tuned a large language model (LLMs) with data scraped from the universityâ€™s portal, integrated a hybrid RAG pipeline and incorporated an Agentic decision-making layer. I have also applied machine learning to optimize tourism marketing strategies and conducted impactful research with the Redcar & Cleveland Voluntary Development Agency RCVDA) where I, analyzed how transportation accessibility affects hospital appointment attendance. The work aimed to improve healthcare access in the community and mitigate the cost associated with missed appointments. I enjoy transforming complex data into meaningful, actionable solutions. aiming to create real-world impact.
